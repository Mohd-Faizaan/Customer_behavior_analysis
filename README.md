# Customer_behavior_analysis
Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data by performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), database querying, and dashboard visualization. The final outputs include a Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer-level data such as:

Demographics (e.g., age, gender)

Purchase information

Review ratings

Subscription and discount details

Data is loaded and processed using Python before being stored and queried from a SQL database.

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (Dashboard & visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook (EDA & data cleaning)

Gamma (PowerPoint / presentation creation)

Project Steps

Data Loading

Load raw dataset into Python using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand data structure and distributions.

Identify missing values and outliers.

Generate summary statistics and visualizations.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., median imputation).

Create derived features (e.g., age groups).

Standardize and validate data.

SQL Analysis

Store cleaned data in a relational database.

Write SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales, and subscriptions.

Dashboard Development

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Include KPIs, charts, slicers, and category-level insights.

Reporting & Presentation

Summarize key insights in a written report.

Create a presentation using Gamma for stakeholder communication.

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

Average purchase amount

Average review rating

Total number of customers

Revenue and sales by category

Subscription status distribution

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

Results & Insights

Identified key customer segments and purchasing patterns.

Analyzed revenue contribution by product category.

Compared behavior between subscribed and non-subscribed customers.

Provided data-driven insights to support business decisions.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Install required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy psycopg2


Run the Jupyter notebooks for EDA and data cleaning.

Load cleaned data into the SQL database.

Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.

Review the report and presentation for summarized insights.
